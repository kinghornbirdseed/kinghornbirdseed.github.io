This website has been set up to support the fundraising of Scouts and Explorer Scouts travelling to the World Scout Jamboree in South Korea. We are 2 Scouts that have been lucky enough to be selected to attend the 25th World Scout Jamboree in South Korea in 2023. We are planning to fundraise through a variety of methods - this website will assist us in doing so.

We hope to use this site as a blog, a contact mechanism, and as an ordering system. If you have any questions please don't hesitate to contact us through the order forms, or by emailing sales@kinghornbirdseed.co.uk.

If you are looking for the bird seed or glass recycling services, please use the links in the menu at the top of the page.

Many thanks for your support,
Archie and Oliver.
